## Notebooks
In the notebooks directory, there currently exists 1 notebook, `train_and_gen_cnote.ipynb`, which demonstrates the complete workflow for training a control direction and generating controlled music with MusicRFM.

You can
1. **Train** a control direction for a specific musical attribute (note C vs other notes)
2. **Generate** music with controlled attributes using the trained direction
3. **Compare** baseline vs controlled outputs

Audio files will be saved to `./trained_concepts/generations/`

You will need to install `notebook`, and `ipython` to display the audio properly.
